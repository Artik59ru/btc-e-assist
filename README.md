This is an open-source app for BTC-e.com that allows you trade and stay tuned in any time and any place with Internet connection.

The "JUST BUY" and "JUST SELL" features allow you to make maximum purchase or sale order without choosing the price and amount.

You can easily switch between all your BTC-e accounts with just few touches (this app uses safe API methods that make it possibly to log in without adding an username and password).

This app also allows you to read chat messages on Russian, English and Chinese. Please note that you can not post messages because this feature requests user's login and password that can not be added in app by security reasons.


Caution: We strongly recommend to use unical API-key for each device.
You can create one on the https://btc-e.com/profile#api_keys page
